dumbaes is a really dumb implementation of AES-128.

It's a class project. It should give you the right answer, but it is not fit for
real world use. The implementation is slow and stupid. It's vulnerable to all
sorts of side-channel attacks. Don't use it.

Pronounciation: you can probably figure this out yourself.

Requirements for tarball builds:

 * A C++14 compiler for binary literals. (GCC 5 should work. Tested with GCC 6.)
 * GLib >= 2.32.
 * That's it!

Additional requirements for builds from git:

 * autoconf, automake, libtool
 * A quite recent version of autoconf-archive (uses macros added in 2015)

Usage:

# If building from a tarball:
./configure
# Build the code:
make
# Running the tests would be a dandy swell idea:
make check

Once it's built, try out an example program:

***TODO***: write a demo program and add instructions for use here

You can install it with `sudo make install` if you really want to, but this
library is dumb, so why would you?

If you're building from git, you need to run autogen.sh rather than configure.

-Werror is enabled for builds from git. The recommended way to turn it off if
you hit compiler warnings is to pass --disable-Werror to configure.
