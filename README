dumbaes is a really dumb implementation of AES-128.

It's a class project. It should give you the right answer, but it is not fit for
real world use. The implementation is slow and stupid. It's vulnerable to all
sorts of side-channel attacks. Don't use it.

Requirements for tarball builds:

 * A C++14 compiler for binary literals. (GCC 5 should work. Tested with GCC 6.)
 * GLib >= 2.32
 * That's it!

Additional requirements for builds from git:

 * autoconf, automake, libtool
 * A quite recent version of autoconf-archive (uses macros added in 2015)

Usage:

# If building from a tarball:
./configure
# Build the code:
make
# Running the tests would be a dandy swell idea:
make check
# You can run it from the source directory, but if you want to install it:
sudo make install
# To run it from the source directory:
src/dumbaes

If you're building from git, you need to run autogen.sh rather than configure.

-Werror is enabled for builds from git. The recommended way to turn it off if
you hit compiler warnings is to pass --disable-Werror to configure.

There is no provision for user input. That is, the program is basically useless
as-is. It is intended to be used for homework projects by modifying main() to
perform the math you need. Yes, I know that sucks.
